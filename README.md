# Atlas Risk Systems

### Set Up

The current application is built using Node v8.4.0 and npm v5.4.0. In order for things to run properly you'll need to use these versions.

1. Clone the repository
2. npm install while `cd`'d into the `server` file path
..* You will need to create a `dev.js` (.gitignore) file in the `config` folder for the development environment variables (slack me to get the code).
3. npm install while `cd`'d into the `client` file path
4. Create a separate branch from master, i.e `work-branch`
..* Use the `work-branch` for making any changes to source code.
..* Commit any change as a separate commit message specifying briefly what changes were made.
..* Push changes to the remote `origin` using your `work-branch`, `git push origin [work-branch]`
5. Create PR on GitHub repo and list any details in the PR notes.
..* DO NOT merge PR until it's been reviewed by someone else.
6. After PR has successfully been merged delete the `work-branch`
